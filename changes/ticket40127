  o Minor features (compilation):
    - When building Tor, first link all object files into a single
      static library. This may help with embedding Tor in other
      programs.  Note that most Tor functions do not constitute a
      part of a stable or supported API: Only those functions in
      tor_api.h should be used if embedding Tor.  Closes ticket

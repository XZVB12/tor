  o Minor features (bootstrap reporting):
    - When reporting bootstrapping status on a relay, do not consider
      connections that have never been the target of an origin circuit.
      Previously, all connection failures were treated as potential
      bootstrapping failures, including those that had been opened because of
      client requests. Closes ticket 25061.
